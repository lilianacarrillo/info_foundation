## Anyone is able to deliver capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.

**In this article, we discuss the general concept of a ‘decentralized grid’.**

### Decentralization

In 1989 the internet changed the world as we know it. The internet gave us the power to share information in a decentralized way. In turn, the blockchain now allows us to decentalize value, which could change the world further.

Companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon made big business out of the internet. The “sharing economy” has been growing over the last 5-10 years. This is thanks to a more simplified information flow and well-developed technology, which:

1. Enables a much easier integration of independent players into the sharing economy.
2. Eliminates the need for extensive management and structure of a marketplace operators.

We are at the dawn of a flat-structure economy. An economy where we need less managerial levels for the system to function in a good way.

Blockchain technology facilitates this ongoing trend. Participants can now interact on a peer-to-peer basis and form marketplaces and organizations according to pre-agreed, programmed contracts.

### Surprisingly the internet still centralized

Despite already seeing well-known examples of decentralized currencies, transportation, and ledgers. We do not yet have decentralized datacenter technology, the very core of the internet as we know it.

To compete in the internet capacity market which is now dominated by big IT companies, one requires massive investments.

Over the last couple of years, ThreeFold developed decentralized datacenter technology. One of the benefits of this technology is that it allows anyone to take part in the internet capacity market.
 Anyone that joins the ThreeFold Grid we call a ThreeFold Farmers. to invest. All such participants are called ThreeFold Farmers (TFM).

### How to become a ThreeFold Farmer

The process to become a TF Farmer is very straightforward. Anyone can join the TF Grid by buying or building a Zero Node.
Now you can operate your micro datacenter and earn money with it, we call this process TF Mining.

All Zero-Nodes are “plug and play” with full self-driving capability. This means anyone can become a TF farmer, no matter the level of experience. Which means anyone can become an ‘Airbnb’ TF Farmer for the new, neutral internet which belongs to us all.


Internet Capacity produced by a Zero-Node is automatically registered on the TF Directory. The TF Directory is a public directory for global purchasers of Internet Capacity. There is no need to build a marketing department or promote your Zero-Node.

Pricing is set by the TF Directory's algorithm based on numerous factors including real-time local supply and demand, competition, network connection, hardware type and the environment. More advanced TF Farmers can set their own pricing.
