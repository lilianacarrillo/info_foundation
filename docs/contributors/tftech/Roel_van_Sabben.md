## why do I exist in TF 

My existence in TF came from me project managing certain task and getting them done no matter what.
I am currently here as a part of the marketing team overseeing our digital assets and the documentation of them.
Also UI/UX, Art Direction and more are part of my day in day out tasks. When needed I assist my colleagues and help them smash goals. Teamplayer could be my middle name. (it isn't)
