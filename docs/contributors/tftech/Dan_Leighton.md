## About me

- I went to Cambridge University, and still live there, and completed a Masters in Biological Anthropology, I still view myself as a scientist at heart. I spent the first ten years or so of my career in the early internet industry building and marketing data centres, hosting products, and software. I also took in advertising, marketing and publishing along the way. After a career change, I spent the next fourteen years as a professional educator specialising in cloud technologies and educational leadership. After leaving professional education, I set up my own company to create tools for artificial intelligence and machine learning in natural language processing applications. I also have a second Master degree in creative writing with a specialism in poetry and play-writing. I play and compose both traditional and choral music and sings bass and tenor in a chamber choir. I sail a classic wooden yacht with my wonderful wife and daughter.

## My Priorities 

- Helping the BetterToken team to be the best they can!
