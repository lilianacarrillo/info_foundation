## why do I exist in TF 

- To Answer my "Why" -
I selfishly throughly enjoy seeing people suceed and by doing so I feel I have in turn suceeded.

Whether it is TF or any project I personaly spend time on, my contribution to the people working on the project is to make sure that we are personlly growing towards a the goal that on a basic level answers the question "are you leaving this world in a better place than you found it today?".


## My Priorities 
- To make sure the TF operations are functioning effectively within our values. 
- To provide the correct support to TF Team members so they also as able to effectively grow.
