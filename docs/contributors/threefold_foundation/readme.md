# ThreeFold Foundation

Legally spoken is trust in mauritius, has no people on payroll !
The Foundation today has no funding, only the 3 companies below have funding.

A lot of funding comes from the past e.g. TF Innovate = past exits.

Mazraa & Bettertoken have funding from early farming on the TF Grid.

All people working for the foundation are funded by one of the supporting companies.

- [Mazraa UAE = token promotion](../mazrraa/readme.md) from out of Dubai
- [BetterToken BE = TF Tech = grid promotion & tech creation](../tftech/readme.md) from out of Dubai
- [TF Innovate BE = Incubaid NV BE](../tfinnovate/readme.md) our incubator in Belgium, now also coming to Spain

everyone is legally supported (sponsored) from out of one of those organizations.

The people who work over all org's are put in this directory, but probably paid for by Mazraa.
