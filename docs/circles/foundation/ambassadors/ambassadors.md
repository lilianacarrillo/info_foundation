## Purpose/Mission

- To bring incremental global knowledge and support to the TF movement from outside.  
- To bring the TF story to a broader international community.
- Create global market pull for TF tokens, TF farming and TF grid utilisation by multiplying TF’s resources
- Community building by engaging community members to be a part of the TF movement
- Help spread the word, open up networks, have an advisory role, organize and host events, support token sales &     farming

...

## Goals

- Create an ambassador program that attracts significant personalities with diverse knowledge, experience, network.  
- Execute ambassador-led TF events in all relevant markets by end 2018.
- Have 20+ active working groups composed of ambassadors and TF staff addressing relevant challenges and opportunities of TF.
- Scale to 1000 ambassadors by end 2019.

...

## Strategy

- Develop a program which enables scalable knowledge sharing between ambassadors and TF.  

- Search for, recruit, engage and retain ambassadors to the joint benefit of both ambassadors and TF.

- Launch new ambassador category of “Guardians” and define exact roles and responsibilities and remuneration. Recruit guardians out of  existing pool of ambassadors and if needed from outside - being referred by TF members and ambassadors.

- Extend ambassador community work to include friends and family and other investors - assuming they want a more active role in designing the future of and the success of TF

- Create a special category of ambassadors that includes market-making influencers and big names of the industry that like our idea and would endorse and support in various areas, speak at events for us and give us advice.

...

## Timing
