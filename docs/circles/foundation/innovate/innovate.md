## Strategy:
 
“Expo”:  Showcase technologies and competencies of TF (and GIG) in a demo area (including a local farm).
show also adjacent and additional businesses like Veda, Africa Fund and it’s “good projects”
also partners like BetterToken can exhibit…overall common theme will be “doing good” (body/mind/environment/inclusion/emerging markets..) and token-driven businesses.
 
“Power Up”: invite early stage start-ups with coaching/mentoring by TF staff (me for instance) and pledging shares to TF – could be technologies close to us (blockchain businesses, crypto businesses) but also other Ibiza based (technology) start-ups and other European start-ups that want to benefit from the location and from proximity to us. we can collect a fee from them for office usage, infrastructure incl. legal, finance, management skills, even funding if we create a start-up incubation fund (TF2 Fund)
 
Bus Dev: “ThreeFold Labs”: TF assists companies in “tokenizing” their business –TF delivers innovation assessment, business planning, POCs and MVPs as a paid-for service and with a revenue sharing agreement plus condition to use TFT or white-labelled TFT. concretely we sell 1 week workshops following an assessment engagement at the customer site
 
Infrastructure:
Office space for TF staff (and visiting TF staff) – mobile workspaces and hot-desking only which can also be used for other companies (resident and non-resident)
 
Offer meeting rooms and seminar rooms (one of which for 100+ people) so that external companies can also rent and use. and to do ambassador meetings, investor meetings etc
 
partnership with hotels and fincas across the island so that the facility canbe utilised in the incentive/corporate/retreat travel to the island
 
 
work with Ibiza governor to position Ibiza and our incubator as a hi-tech/crypto location and get government support
